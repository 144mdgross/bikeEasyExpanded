# bikeEasy

bikeEasy is a mobile app that makes commutes between Boulder, Denver and Longmont simpler.
In an ordinary commute with a bike between cities, people need to do three separate searches on Google Maps 
to get all the information they need for their trip. This is a frustrating process to go through 
when you're trying to get places. bikeEasy fixes that by giving you all the information you need 
in one search. 

***Technologies***: React-Native, JavaScript, Google Directions Service API, and my own API [bikeEasyRoutes](https://github.com/144mdgross/bikeEasyRoutes) built with Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL
